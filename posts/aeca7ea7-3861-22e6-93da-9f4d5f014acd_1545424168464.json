There I am getting a 403,forbidden error, here not.</p> <p> So here's something, looks like BigTablesupports temp tables, which is something I do not think Hive does. For thatmatter, these BigTable queries seem to go a lot faster than Hive queries I'mused to, but that may also be because these tables are really not that big.</p><p>Just finished the SQL tutorial. There is not much there for anyone who hasalready been writing a lot of queries. For me, because I have not used an SQLflavor that allows these common table expressions (CTE's also known as temporarytables), this is good to know about.</p> <p> Predicting time series data is anice intro to long term/short term memories LSTM's that I do not understand.</p> <p>The other stuff on time series is a lot of code, and not a lot of commentary. The videos are well done, but I am still getting used to learning from videos.</p> <p> On to the R module. I see this one has two levels.\n<p> Notes for December 15th, 2018</p> <p>For my 5 day plus training, I will be studying the material in </p> <ul> <li><a href='https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview'>https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview</a></li> </ul> <p> If I have time I will also study:</p> <ul> <li><a href='http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/'>http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/</a></li> <li><a href='https://github.com/GokuMohandas/practicalAI'>https://github.com/GokuMohandas/practicalAI</a></li> </ul> <p>Useful things I learned from the Python intro:</p> <ul> <li>First lesson: <ul> <li>Python floor operator: //</li> </ul> </li> <li>Lesson on functions &amp; getting help: <ul> <li>can give int() function as key to min, <i>i.e.<i/>: min(string_1, string_2, string_3, key=int) </li> </ul> <li>Lesson on booleans: <ul> <li>Python will automatically convert booleans to integers: True + True = 2.</li> </ul> </ul>\n<p>put some html markup in there</p> <h1>Post it</h1>\ntest 2258\ntest 1\n<p>Entry for December 17th, 2018</p> <p>Starting off the day with Kaggle questions.</p> <p>The first thing I notice is that the commit utility is rather slow - so it seems like it always takes a few minutes to save one's work when using the Kaggle exercise system.</p> <p>Today I would like to continue doing the Kaggle exercises, as well as some of the items in the to-do list.</p> <p>The project board is a really great tool in this Wiki for planning out work.</p> <p>Here is a good reference for desigining objects in JavaScript: <a href='https://crockford.com/javascript/private.html'>https://crockford.com/javascript/private.html</a> </p>Wow! really nice, just paste the commit SHA into a note in a Github project note on the kanban board, and it becomes a hyperlink!</p> <p>Ok, done adding some object orientation to the blog software</p> <p>In the slot machine demo - I didn't think to subtract the cost of playing the slot machine itself. Also, interesting opportunity to apply the law of large numbers. The experiment is computing the average cost of playing the slot machine, and repeating it multiple times and averaging the outcome of the experiment will give a value that approaches the true expected average cost.</p> <p>Something to note, that one might get lazy about with Python is we don't have to worry about String.equals, I can compare strings with str1==str2</p> <p>Interesting construct I never heard of: dictionary comprehensions, syntax is similar to list comprehensions, but using {}'s instead.</p> <p>Well, I feel a little small about this, but, at least for the Pandas data frame that the describe() function returns, the syntax to access an element of that description data frame - say the data frame is named df - df['column_name']['row_name']. I am used to thinking of 2-dimensional arrays as accessed by [row][column], so that's the transpose of what I am used to.</p> <p>The machine learning tutorial is very basic, best for someone who knows zero about machine learning.</p>\ntest 2255\ntest 2303\ntest text\nas they say on slashdot, first post\n<p>Entry for December 19th, 2018</p> <p>Now, it seems we get to the good stuff - things I've never really heard about before. Transfer learning. Take a trained model, replace the last layer with something new, and train just that last layer. This is extremely useful.</p> <p>Lesson 4 of the deep learning tutorial covers this.</p> <p>Interesting, it seems the example code is importing from Keras libraries within TensorFlow, not Keras by itself.</p> <p>Interesting note from lesson 6 in the Deep Learning track: Becker says, models with dense layers for tabular data, models with convolutional layers for images. Why?</p> <p>Batch size = # of rows (tabular data), or # of images (image data)</p> <p>'...use validation scores as ultimate measure of model quality...' - Dan Becker, Kaggle Deep Learning Track, Lesson 7</p> <p>Really important side note: in vim, in whatever the non-insert mode is called, I think it is called command mode, but if you have the cursor on the curly brace or whatever and you type '%' it will jump to the closing, and oh, wow, ctrl-o goes to the previous location, and ctrl-i or &gt;tab&lt; goes to next location. Those are huge.</p> <p> Ok, on to the data visualization module. The deep learning module is a bare introduction. </p> <p> The data visualization model is, I think best as a reference to see what commands create which types of charts. </p> <p> As an aside, how to extract certain columns:</p> <pre> df=pd.DataFrame({'col1':[1,3,4,5], 'col2':[1,2,3,4], 'col3':[1,4,5,6]}) df.loc[:,['col1','col3']] </pre> <p> In the data visualization track, in the seaborn section, there is a good explanation of box plots. I did not know, or I have forgotten that half the data is in the box. </p> <p> Ok, so I learned something really good from the visualization tutorial - the plotly library is easy to install and use in python now. For some reason I was thinking one needed to get an API key from plotly to use the library, but that is not the case. I just set up a virtual environment with plotly, pandas, and jupyter, and I can do the same plots that are in the tutorial.</p> <p> The other thing that is cool about plotly, that I didn't even know what they are called is choropleths, which are visualizations like maps with countries colored in according to some statistic.</p> <p> Onto their SQL tutorial, it's using google big query, which is interesting. I think Google is offering an alternative to hadoop and especially hive here, maybe HBase + Phoenix too. I wonder which it is closer to.</p>\n<p>Well, I just learned something cool that I can write htmlon the  items in the Github project kan-ban and that works.</p> <p>I am workingon the blog software again now.</p> <p>We are going back to the idea of savingthe posts as json data.</p><p>Last night I realized it kind of doesn't makesense to search the commits totry and figure out when a post is committed.</p>\ntest 2252\n<p>Entry for December 18th, 2018</p> <p>Today, on the GitBlog side I will put in the post functionality, I think.</p> <p>Another thought is I should probably try twitter bootstrap css</p> <p>Right now, I'll continue on the Pandas tutorial on the Kaggle site.</p> <p>Here is a nice one-liner for reading a dataframe from sqlite3:</p> <pre> music_reviews = pd.read_sql_query('select 1545321590990.html 1545321590990.json 1545322276130.html 1545322276130.json 1545322405355.html 1545322405355.json 1545322465365.html 1545322465365.json 1545364170261.html 1545364170261.json 1545364369876.html 1545364369876.json 1545364559794.html 1545364559794.json 1545364707969.html 1545364707969.json 1545364815617.html 1545364815617.json 1545364992845.html 1545364992845.json 2018_12_15.html 2018_12_15.json 2018_12_16.html 2018_12_16.json 2018_12_17.html 2018_12_17.json 2018_12_18.html 2018_12_18.json 2018_12_19.html 2018_12_20.html 2018_12_21.json jsonify-posts.sh from artists', sqlite3.connect('../input/pitchfork-data/database.sqlite')) </pre> <p>And here is how to set the values of indices:</p> <pre> animals = pd.DataFrame({'Cows': [12, 20], 'Goats': [22, 19]}, index=['Year 1', 'Year 2']) </pre> <p>Select the first row of a dataframe df:</p> <pre>df.iloc[0]</pre> <p>First 10 values of a column:</p> <pre> df.column_name.iloc[:10]</pre> <p>Pick and choose rows:</p> <pre>df.iloc[[1,2,3,5,8]]</pre> <p>Still doing the Pandas tutorial, this is the correct answer for number 7:</p> <pre>df = reviews[['country', 'variety']].iloc[0:100]</pre> <p>Which seems to me to be the opposite of what they just quoted in the documentation</p> <p>Another good point about doing the Kaggle tutorials is that it teaches using the Kaggle environment, which is basically Jupyter, but with bells &amp; whistles that Kaggle has added on.</p> <p>Median value of dataframe df's column_name column:</p> <pre>df.describe().column_name['50%']</pre> <p>Wow, didn't know this would work. Subtract mean value of column with name column_name from every value in column_name, using some dataframe named df:</p> <pre>mean_column_name_values = df.column_name - (df.describe().column_name['mean'])</pre> <p>It seems like:</p> <pre>df.column_name.value_counts()</pre> <p>and</p> <pre>df.groupby('column_name').size()</pre> <p>Get the same data, but it is organized differently. It seems like the point of it in the tutorial is that </p> <pre>df.groupby('column_name').size() creates a series with indices that are values we are counting. </pre> <p>df.groupby(['column_1', 'column_2']) creates a multi-index</p> <p>Important syntax note for dataframes - one can reference a column, and then apply a function to every value in the column, like so:</p> <pre>df.column_name.function()</pre> <p>I think the function must be a method of the Pandas Series object.</p> <p>I was thinking of stealing some example code for implementing commit and push for the blog, but it appears to be a dead end - there is some mature code for using the Github REST API in JavaScript, but I would end up adding thousands of lines of code to get that functionality - lots of dependent libraries, so in the end it will probably be better to follow the tutorial and do the steps the author recommends, but write my own functions, referencing the github API documentation.</p> <p> I am trying kaggle in FireFox. It seems chrome is unstable for this. Also, it chrome flickers when committing, which is really not good.</p> <p> I think Kaggle itself, might be kind of busy, but it looks like the commit dialog box that opens does not cause the page to flicker in FireFox, which is wonderful. </p> <p> Just learned something important - pre-trained models are available on Kaggle. For example, Resnet50.</p> <p> Ok, maybe I got too excited there, looks like they're possibly taking credit for some models built in to TensorFlow. Oh, maybe not, I think maybe they have weights stored for us to use.</p>\ntest 2300\ntest 2248\n<p>December 16th, 2018</p> <p>This morning, I went off on a tangent. Github has a rest API. I added some proof-of-concept code to this page in the js/site_functions.js file. It should be possible to read and write blog posts using the Github rest API. The proof of concept code is now setting the contents of the div with id blog_posts at the top of this page. </p> <p>Back to the Kaggle tutorials, onto a review of lists in Python. <p>Things were going great with the Github API blog project, until I blew my quota. I did not know unauthenticated requets are limited to 60 per hour per IP address.</p> <p>Interesting things from Kaggle tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Lists tutorial:</li> <ul> <li>Python numbers have a .as_integer_raio() method that returns the numerator and denomenator.</li> </ul> </ul> <p><i>2305</i> I feel like I might have gone overboard with the blogging software today &semi; I meant to work on this slowly, over a longer period of time, but it is quite addictive.</p> <p>So, anyway, now we can write blog posts and retrieve them, but there's no limit on the number of posts we might show, and we need to add some error message if the user is over the quota</p> <p>Which brings me to the second point, this blog software really does not work for mass consumption, at least at present because after a few refreshes, the account that the github.io project that hosts the blog will get rate limited.</p> <p>What we need is to statically render the page that displays the posts - probably when a new post is added.</p> <p>The page where one can add a post should be oath token protected. <p>We also need to add a user-friendly error message when the account is over quota.</p>"}
