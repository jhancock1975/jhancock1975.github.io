<p>Entry for December 17th, 2018</p>
<p>Starting off the day with Kaggle questions.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is that the commit utility is rather slow - so it seems like it always takes a few minutes to save one's work when using the Kaggle exercise system.</p>
<p>Today I would like to continue doing the Kaggle exercises, as  well as some of the items in the to-do list.</p>
<p>The project board is a really great tool in this Wiki for planning out work.</p>
