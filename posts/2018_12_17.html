<p>Entry for December 17th, 2018</p>
<p>Starting off the day with Kaggle questions.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is that the commit utility is rather slow - so it seems like it always takes a few minutes to save one's work when using the Kaggle exercise system.</p>
<p>Today I would like to continue doing the Kaggle exercises, as  well as some of the items in the to-do list.</p>
<p>The project board is a really great tool in this Wiki for planning out work.</p>
<p>Here is a good reference for desigining objects in JavaScript:

</p>Wow! really nice, just paste the commit SHA into a note in a Github project note on the kanban board, and it becomes a hyperlink!</p>
<p>Ok, done adding some object orientation to the blog software</p>
<p>In the slot machine demo - I didn't think to subtract the cost of playing the slot machine itself.  Also, interesting
  opportunity to apply the law of large numbers.  The experiment is computing the average cost of playing the slot machine,
  and repeating it multiple times and averaging the outcome of the experiment will give a value that approaches the true expected average cost.</p>
<p>Something to note, that one might get lazy about with Python is we don't have to worry about String.equals, I can compare strings with str1==str2</p>
<p>Interesting construct I never heard of: dictionary comprehensions, syntax is similar to list comprehensions, but using {}'s instead.</p>
<p>Well, I feel a little small about this, but, at least for the Pandas data frame that the describe() function returns, the syntax to access an element of that description data frame - say the data frame is named df - df['column_name']['row_name'].  I am used to thinking of 2-dimensional arrays as accessed by [row][column], so that's the transpose of what I am used to.</p>
<p>The machine learning tutorial is very basic, best for someone who knows zero about machine learning.</p>
