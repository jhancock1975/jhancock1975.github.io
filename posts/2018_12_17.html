<p>Entry for December 17th, 2018</p>
<p>Starting off the day with Kaggle questions.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is that the commit utility is rather slow - so it seems like it always takes a few minutes to save one's work when using the Kaggle exercise system.</p>
<p>Today I would like to continue doing the Kaggle exercises, as  well as some of the items in the to-do list.</p>
<p>The project board is a really great tool in this Wiki for planning out work.</p>
<p>Here is a good reference for desigining objects in JavaScript: 
  <a href='https://crockford.com/javascript/private.html'>https://crockford.com/javascript/private.html</a>
</p>Wow! really nice, just paste the commit SHA into a note in a Github project note on the kanban board, and it becomes a hyperlink!</p>
<p>Ok, done adding some object orientation to the blog software</p>
