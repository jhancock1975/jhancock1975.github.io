with some more work on the blog software since we are starting early.</p> <p>Ok,
been coding up the save blog post functionality for a while yet this morning,
just found another really nice vim shortcut that I'm sure everyone already
knows, but I am writing about it to help it stick in my memory, and this
shortcut is hitting '*' in command mode, will jump to the next occurrence of a
word under a string, almost as good as 'goto definition' in and IDE.</p> <p>
Back to the Kaggle SQL tutorial...</p> <p> Something strange - it seems I am
able to query the open air quality database in the forked notebook, but not in
another one that I created from a different exercise. There I am getting a 403,
forbidden error, here not.</p> <p> So here's something, looks like BigTable
supports temp tables, which is something I do not think Hive does. For that
matter, these BigTable queries seem to go a lot faster than Hive queries I'm
used to, but that may also be because these tables are really not that big.</p>
<p>Just finished the SQL tutorial. There is not much there for anyone who has
already been writing a lot of queries. For me, because I have not used an SQL
flavor that allows these common table expressions (CTE's also known as temporary
tables), this is good to know about.</p> <p> Predicting time series data is a
nice intro to long term/short term memories LSTM's that I do not understand.</p> <p>The other stuff on time series is a lot of code, and not a lot of commentary. The videos are well done, but I am still getting used to learning from videos.</p> <p> On to the R module. I see this one has two levels."}
