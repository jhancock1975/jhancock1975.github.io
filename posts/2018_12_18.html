<p>Entry for December 18th, 2018</p>
<p>Today, on the GitBlog side I will put in the post functionality, I think.</p>
<p>Another thought is I should probably try twitter bootstrap css</p>
<p>Right now, I'll continue on the Pandas tutorial on the Kaggle site.</p>
<p>Here is a nice one-liner for reading a dataframe from sqlite3:</p>
<pre>
music_reviews = pd.read_sql_query('select * from artists', sqlite3.connect('../input/pitchfork-data/database.sqlite'))
</pre>
<p>And here is how to set the values of indices:</p>
<pre>
animals = pd.DataFrame({'Cows': [12, 20], 'Goats': [22, 19]}, index=['Year 1', 'Year 2'])
</pre>
<p>Select the first row of a dataframe df:</p>

<pre>df.iloc[0]</pre>

<p>First 10 values of a column:</p>

<pre> df.column_name.iloc[:10]</pre>

<p>Pick and choose rows:</p>

<pre>df.iloc[[1,2,3,5,8]]</pre>

<p>Still doing the Pandas tutorial, this is the correct answer for number 7:</p>
<pre>df = reviews[['country', 'variety']].iloc[0:100]</pre>
<p>Which seems to me to be the opposite of what they just quoted in the
documentation</p>

<p>Another good point about doing the Kaggle tutorials is that it teaches using
  the  Kaggle environment, which is basically Jupyter, but with bells &amp; 
  whistles that Kaggle has added on.</p>

<p>Median value of dataframe df's column_name column:</p>
<pre>df.describe().column_name['50%']</pre>

<p>Wow, didn't know this would work.  Subtract mean value of column with name
  column_name from every value in column_name, using some dataframe named
  df:</p>

<pre>mean_column_name_values = df.column_name - (df.describe().column_name['mean'])</pre>
