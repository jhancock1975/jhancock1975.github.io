<p>Entry for December 19th, 2018</p>

<p>Now, it seems we get to the good stuff - things I've never really heard about
  before.  Transfer learning. Take a trained model, replace the last layer with
  something new, and train just that last layer.  This is extremely
  useful.</p>

<p>Lesson 4 of the deep learning tutorial covers this.</p>

<p>Interesting, it seems the example code is importing from Keras libraries
  within TensorFlow, not Keras by itself.</p>

<p>Interesting note from lesson 6 in the Deep Learning track: Becker says,
  models with dense layers for tabular data, models with convolutional layers for
  images. Why?</p>

<p>Batch size = # of rows (tabular data), or # of images (image data)</p>

<p>"...use validation scores as ultimate measure of model quality..." - Dan
Becker, Kaggle Deep Learning Track, Lesson 7</p>

<p>Really important side note: in vim, in whatever the non-insert mode is
  called, I think it is called command mode, but if you have the cursor on
  the curly brace or whatever and you type  '%' it will jump to the closing, and
  oh, wow, ctrl-o goes to the previous location, and ctrl-i or &gt;tab&lt; goes
  to next location.  Those are huge.</p>

<p>  Ok, on to  the data visualization module.  The deep learning module is a 
  bare introduction. </p>

<p> The data visualization model is, I think best as a reference to see what
commands create which types of charts. </p>

<p> As an aside, how to extract certain columns:</p>
<pre>
df=pd.DataFrame({'col1':[1,3,4,5], 'col2':[1,2,3,4], 'col3':[1,4,5,6]})
df.loc[:,['col1','col3']]
</pre>

<p> In the data visualization track, in the seaborn section, there is a good
  explanation of box plots.  I did not know, or I have forgotten that half
  the data is in the box. </p>

<p> Ok, so I learned something really good from the visualization tutorial - the
  plotly library is easy to install and use in python now.  For some reason I
  was thinking one needed to get an API key from plotly to use the library, 
  but that is not the case.  I just set up a virtual environment with plotly, 
  pandas, and jupyter, and I can do the same plots that are in the tutorial.</p>

<p> The other thing that is cool about plotly, that I didn't even know what they
  are called is choropleths, which are visualizations like maps with countries
  colored in according to some statistic.</p>

<p> Onto their SQL tutorial, it's using google big query, which is interesting.
  I think Google is offering an alternative to hadoop and especially hive here,
  maybe HBase + Phoenix too.  I wonder which it is closer to.</p>
