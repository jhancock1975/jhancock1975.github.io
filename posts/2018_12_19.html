<p>Now, it seems we get to the good stuff - things I've never really heard about
  before.  Transfer learning. Take a trained model, replace the last layer with
  something new, and train just that last layer.  This is extremely
  useful.</p>

<p>Lesson 4 of the deep learning tutorial covers this.</p>

<p>Interesting, it seems the example code is importing from Keras libraries
  within TensorFlow, not Keras by itself.</p>
