<p>Starting off the day with some more work on the blog software since we are
  starting early.</p>

<p>Ok, been coding up the save blog post functionality for a while yet this
  morning, just found another really nice vim shortcut that I'm sure everyone
  already knows, but I am writing about it to help it stick in my memory, and
  this shortcut is hitting '*' in command mode, will jump to the next occurrence
  of a word under a string, almost as good as 'goto definition' in and IDE.</p>
