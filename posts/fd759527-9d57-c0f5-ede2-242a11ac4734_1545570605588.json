I notice we have gone from mean absolute error to root mean squared error.  </p>\n\n<p>Ok, probably way too long to have found this out, but the best way to deal with these Kaggle notebooks when the commit button stops working is to use the cloud buttons to download and upload the notebook.

Intuitive and ... one of those things I feel like I should have thought of... shuffle a column of the validation data, and see if performance goes down.  If it does, we know the column is important.
