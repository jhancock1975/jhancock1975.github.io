'post_content': '<p>December 16th, 2018</p> <p>This morning, I went off on a tangent. Github has a rest API. I added some proof-of-concept code to this page in the js/site_functions.js file. It should be possible to read and write blog posts using the Github rest API. The proof of concept code is now setting the contents of the div with id blog_posts at the top of this page. </p> <p>Back to the Kaggle tutorials, onto a review of lists in Python. <p>Things were going great with the Github API blog project, until I blew my quota. I did not know unauthenticated requets are limited to 60 per hour per IP address.</p> <p>Interesting things from Kaggle tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Lists tutorial:</li> <ul> <li>Python numbers have a .as_integer_raio() method that returns the numerator and denomenator.</li> </ul> </ul> <p><i>2305</i> I feel like I might have gone overboard with the blogging software today &semi; I meant to work on this slowly, over a longer period of time, but it is quite addictive.</p> <p>So, anyway, now we can write blog posts and retrieve them, but there's no limit on the number of posts we might show, and we need to add some error message if the user is over the quota</p> <p>Which brings me to the second point, this blog software really does not work for mass consumption, at least at present because after a few refreshes, the account that the github.io project that hosts the blog will get rate limited.</p> <p>What we need is to statically render the page that displays the posts - probably when a new post is added.</p> <p>The page where one can add a post should be oath token protected. <p>We also need to add a user-friendly error message when the account is over quota.'}
