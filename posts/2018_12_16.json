    <p>This morning, I went off on a tangent.  Github has a rest API.  I added some proof-of-concept code to this page
      in the js/site_functions.js file.  It should be possible to read and write blog posts using the Github rest API.
      The proof of concept code is now setting the contents of the div with id blog_posts at the top of this page.
    </p>
    <p>Back to the Kaggle tutorials, onto a review of lists in Python.
    <p>Things were going great with the Github API blog project, until I blew my quota.
  I did not know unauthenticated requets are limited to 60 per hour per IP address.</p>
 <p>Interesting things from Kaggle tutorial:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Lists tutorial:</li>
   <ul>
     <li>Python numbers have a .as_integer_raio() method that returns the numerator and denomenator.</l
   </ul>
 </ul>
