This repository implements a blog using Github's rest API for creating content.

One can use it to add a blog to one's github pages (github.io) site.

Only users with a valid Github API key are able to post, since this software stores posts to the same github repository where the code for your github.io site resides.

If you would like to fork this repository for your own use, please make sure to update the values for your site in js/site_settings.js.

This software does not create a secure blog, and if you blog with it then your blog is vulnerable to defacement.
